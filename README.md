Kilo
===

Kilo is a small text editor.

Usage: `kilo <filename>`

Keys:

    CTRL-S: Save
    CTRL-Q: Quit
    CTRL-H: HELP
    CTRL-F: Find string in file (ESC to exit search, arrows to navigate)


!["Reditor screenshot"](Screenshot.png "Reditor screenshot") 


Kilo does not depend on any library (not even curses). It uses fairly standard
VT100 (and similar terminals) escape sequences.
